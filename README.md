We Love Movies – Thinkful Capstone Project

Project Type: Backend Web Application
Purpose: Final capstone project for Thinkful’s Backend Engineering curriculum.

Project Overview:
“We Love Movies” is a backend web application designed to manage and serve movie data efficiently. Built as the culminating project in Thinkful’s backend program, this project demonstrates my ability to design RESTful APIs, work with relational databases, and implement server-side logic using modern JavaScript technologies.

Key Features:

Robust backend for managing movie data

Efficient handling of CRUD operations for movie records

Scalable database design with PostgreSQL

Technologies Used:

Node.js – Server-side JavaScript runtime

Express.js – Framework for building RESTful APIs

PostgreSQL – Relational database for storing movie information

Knex.js – SQL query builder for interacting with the database

Getting Started:

Clone the repository

Install dependencies:

npm install


Start the server:

npm start


Access the API at http://localhost:3000

Learning Highlights / Skills Demonstrated:

RESTful API design and implementation

Database schema design and SQL querying

Server-side routing and middleware with Express.js

Integration with a relational database using Knex.js
